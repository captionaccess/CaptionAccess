						Webinars and podcasts are spreading like wildfire, and guess what? Very, very few of them are captioned. It gets harder and harder for deaf and hard-of-hearing people to keep pace with their hearing colleagues in education, business, and the many professional fields that are becoming increasingly Web-centric. Embrace inclusion by captioning your webcasts through CaptionAccess. You can expand your customer base, increase sales, and have a meaningful impact on the lives of people who depend on communication access.

						Equal communication on the job is essential for deaf and hard-of-hearing employees to perform at their best. Captioning ensures that the employee knows what the boss and co-workers say at meetings. Lack of information does not inspire worker productivity. And the transcript of the meeting--which we provide free of charge--can be an invaluable tool for everyone on the team. How often do team members miss a meeting or just plain forget what was said? Too often. CaptionAccess transcripts keep the whole team on the same page.

						Captioning is the preferred form of communication access for an ever-growing number of deaf and hard-of-hearing students in high schools and colleges. Not only does it help students understand the instructor’s words in class, it provides notes in the form of transcripts for review and take-home study. Some students like word-for-word transcription and others prefer a condensed style that captures the essential facts. CaptionAccess delivers captioning and transcripts in whatever way the student or school prefers. Level the road to summa cum laude with CaptionAccess.

						If you’re hosting a conference you want to make sure it’s available to the largest number of people possible. There are 48 million deaf and hard-of-hearing people in the United States. Promoting inclusion by captioning your conference sessions can put more people in the seats. And if you publish conference proceedings, the transcripts produced by captioning will give you a leg up on after-conference work. Want to save money? CaptionAccess works remotely, reducing costs related to travel, lodging, and rates for onsite captioning.

						<p>“Technology is changing the way people receive information and the way people are trained and educated. When educational webcasts are not captioned then people who are deaf or hard of hearing don’t have the same access or the same opportunity to learn that people who can hear do. It's so easy and inexpensive to get webcasts captioned — If webcasters knew how many more people they could reach with the simple addition of captions, it would seem a no brainer to add them. CaptionAccess is unusual among captioning companies in that it advocates and educates for online inclusion in addition to providing services to make it happen.”</p>
